## Biography

#### Early life

Chris was born on 6th August 1959 in Kingston upon Hull. His parents were Thomas and Lieselotte Godsalve (later Cripps), who adopted him in the early 1960’s. Chris knew nothing of his Irish birth parents other than their names - Kavanagh and McRory.

Chris’ father Tom had previously been a staff sergeant in the Royal Berkshire regiment of the British Army, who’s long army career saw him travel across India, Burma, Cyprus and Germany. He later transferred to a role as head chef in the catering corps in the Arborfield camp. Here Chris spent his early years.

Tom left the army abruptly for a low paid job, and the family moved to a tiny caravan. Life in the caravan was hard, they had very little money and the pipes often froze in cold weather preventing access to running water.

#### School years

Things were soon on the up after Tom became a security guard and Lisa started work in a factory. Eventually they were able to afford a house in Southcote, Reading, where Chris went to school. Holidays included trips to stay with Lisa’s family in the Rhineland, Germany where Chris formed a close bond and admiration for his Grandpa ‘Opa Fritz’ who was a communist, a snappy dresser and appreciated Chris’ intelligence and sensitive nature. Chris attended Blessed Hugh Farringdon school, here he met lifelong friend John Devaney. They shared a love of music and astronomy. John introduced Chris to much music, and they attended gigs of many iconic musicians together.

There were some formative events which shaped Chris’ huge sense of social justice and political awareness. Possibly the most powerful of these were his father Tom suffering a debilitating stroke in 1971 but then being declared ‘fit for work’ and social security benefits stopped. Chris became very aware of what he saw as the media demonisation of people accessing support from the government. Chris grew up around men who had been hardened by war and had enormous respect for them but considered himself a pacifist. His mother Lisa amusedly remembered switching on the TV one evening and spotting Chris in a huge crowd on a peace protest in London. She had just started to worry as he hadn’t come home for tea and hadn’t given an inkling where he was going.

Chris’ father Tom sadly died very suddenly of liver cancer in 1977, having been diagnosed just 4 weeks earlier. Chris was 18 and his father’s death impacted him greatly. This was a dark time; Chris became unwell with schizoaffective disorder and spent some time in Fairmile psychiatric hospital. Lisa married Victor Cripps in 1979 after meeting him through the British Legion and acting as a translator with the German branch. Chris gained a brother Bob, and nephew Steve. Vic was instrumental in supporting Chris in his recovery and encouraging him to pursue his studies in maths and physics.


#### University and academic life

Chris went off to university at Heriot-Watt in Edinburgh to study physics. He studied to PhD level over a period of 7 years. Chris worked late into the night on his PhD research project on the university grounds and remembered picking his way through pitch black corridors long after the lights in the building had been switched off. He and his peers were conceptualising and researching a proposed optical computer which was never built, but they thought it could possibly have similar potential to conceptualised quantum computers today.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/184865355@N03/49746474932/in/dateposted-public/" title="Graduation"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49746474932_950aa4a0c7_n.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="Graduation"></a>

Throughout his studies Chris worked hard to support himself financially and had various jobs as a labourer, a warehouse operative and making tea in a bank to name a few. It wasn’t all work and no play; Chris had great friends, and shared an Edinburgh tenement flat with some of them. They went drinking, recorded music together and enjoyed the Edinburgh music scene. After gaining his PhD Chris stayed on at Heriot-Watt for a further 2 years working in research in the physics department.


#### Marriage, family and professional life

In the late 1980’s Chris was volunteering his time at the local council to help people with maths. He struck up a romantic relationship with a student of his, Beatrice Campbell. They fell in love, married in 1990 and had daughter Philippa in 1991. They lived happily in Edinburgh in their Gorgie flat and kept up with good friends. In 1992 they moved to Reading when Chris was offered a job at Reading University as a scientist in the Environmental Systems Science Centre (ESSC) now known as University of Reading Meteorology. Before Chris became too unwell to travel the family enjoyed trips to stay with David and Philippa Campbell, and all had very fond memories of stays at their country house 'Old Costerton'.

Devoted to his work at the ESSC, Chris researched weather systems, cloud physics, atmospheric radiation, remote sensing and much more. He raised money and won grants for his research in the department. He travelled for work, including trips to Utah, USA and later Florence, Italy, where brought along his daughter's favourite teddy 'Charlotte bear' and photographed her taking in all the famous sights, much to Philippa's delight.

Unfortunately, towards the end of his professional life, Chris’ health was mired by Ulcerative Colitis. He struggled on at work with terrible symptoms but was eventually medically retired in 2001 and was too unwell to work again after that. His disease never went into remission despite large doses of steroids and immunomodulating drugs which caused him a myriad of further health problems.


#### Later years

At home, he looked after daughter Philippa, cooked, gave maths and art lessons, masterminded and assisted with many creative projects, and took her to Irish Dancing classes. He managed repairs in the house and maintained the garden. During these years Chris sometimes suffered periods of depression and alcoholism. The family often visited Lisa and Vic, and later Chris set Lisa up with a computer which gave her much pleasure in her last years. Vic sadly passed away in 2007, and Lisa in 2012. Chris spent much time documenting Lisa's life, as well as the lives of Tom and Vic. See 'family' pages on <a href="https://seagods.bitbucket.io/">Chris' Main website.</a>

Chris’ illness made daily life extremely difficult, despite this he continued to apply his commendable work ethic to develop numerous projects including publishing a ‘maths school’, computer programming including graphics software, and further research into environmental physics. He kept his foot in the academic world writing papers and was in touch with Nobel prize winning scientists about his work.

In 2012 Chris was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after feeling increasingly short of breath for some time. He had lost a significant amount of lung function. The prognosis was not good, but with the help of home oxygen Chris was able to retain independence and continue his work. Chris had a recent breakthrough with migrating a computer graphics project to Microsoft Windows and had more he wanted to achieve.

In later years his brother Bob was a huge practical and moral support for Chris and Beatrice, and always helped with taking Chris to his numerous blood tests and specialist appointments, and visiting and bringing him home from increasingly frequent stays in hospital. Chris sadly passed away on 29th March 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic after a short battle with the disease. He will be missed terribly by family and friends.

## More on Chris, by Beatrice

Chris was adopted as a baby. Slow to develop during the first months, he made up for this, teaching himself to read by the age of 3 and eagerly anticipating the visits from the mobile library. Very disorientated and withdrawn at the start of his schooling, concerned teachers were relieved to see a change in him, standing up to a bully and making friends, and occasionally sneaking past his father’s house to buy treats with his dinner money! 
Despite suffering from asthma severe eczema, Chris would be outside in all weathers, working hard with his father, the skin on his hands sometimes raw. He took on the walking of his mother’s aggressive dog Cesar and often got injured in the middle of dog fights. It was hard for Chris to control him, but Chris never gave up and even entered him into the occasional dog show! 

There was very little income after his father’s stroke. Clothes and accessories in fashion were too expensive for him, including and Afghan coat which he coveted. Undeterred, Chris drew on his own artistic creativity for a ‘punk’ style. Growing up fast, Chris was never too grand to help old ladies cross the street.

Chris’ life became very full with friends. He and his best friend John attended concerts and events all over the country. John had great musical knowledge and introduced Chris to much music too. There was so much violence. Chris rescued his friends, diffusing tensions and standing by them. One cold night he carried a friend home. He toughed out concussion himself, and many other injuries. Chris’ eczema was really bad, but he would still party with his very close friends, unless in hospital. Stripping down to his eczema bandages, there are photos of him dancing wildly. Later during his life Chris would find himself being flung repeatedly onto a hard concrete floor in the pursuit of mastering Kung Fu. His teacher Lucas Castrounis and Chris shared mutual admiration for their disciplines. He and his friends would go rock climbing with treacherous quick sands to navigate. Sometimes, waiting for a bus their play fights would become so unruly that the bus drivers would be astonished to see them break off the fight and form an orderly queue. 

As a member of the artists City and Guilds Chris became a respected artist, one patron who’s portrait he painted took him to Harley Street, London by Taxi from Reading in order to satisfy her heroin addiction.

A snappy dresser with an ear for a tune, Opa Fritz recognized Chris’ gifts, reminding family how he could take a clock apart and reassemble it, mending watches too. Chris idolized his grandfather and had to be stopped from eating raw bacon because he thought that’s what Opa Friz was doing! Like his grandfather, Chris became a snappy dresser. Other members of his German family noted his appreciation of his aunt’s recitation of die Nibelungenlied and his appreciation of art books. They were touched by this and Chris was given the books. He developed a love of Brecht and Kurt Weil, a boost to his learning German.

Chris was a beloved son in law. He shared so many interests withhis inlaws  and many good times, and they were very supportive. In later years he set his mum up with a computer and helped her to use it. In hospital and in the pub, Chris attracted people like a powerful magnet. He was christened ‘Care in the Community Chris’. He would always help, either teaching, making a phone call to help a local woman out of an abusive flat-share, or encouraging a friend to further study. He also took part in sleep-outs for the homeless. When helping others with a problem he would respond to a question with another thought-provoking question to encourage critical thinking. Problem solving sometimes took longer this way!

Sometimes Chris drank too much, suddenly our calm world became uncertain. However, time spent in the local pub led to friendships and advice on household problems such as dry rot. Chris would turn his hand to anything, changing washers on taps, or even plastering. He would arrange appointments and managed routine household checks and repairs. After a storm he climbed up into the branches of our large tree, frantically pruning damaged branches, determined to do the work himself. He laughed when he recalled how his mother and stepdad sometimes struggled to agree on DIY. Once they had a plan, he would encourage them to go out and would often carry out much of it himself. 

His love for animals became apparent on early visits to his in-laws. He could not resist stroking a little pony in a nearby field despite suffering a terrible asthma attack due to his severe allergies to animals. This happened twice. An additional member to our household, a small fish caused a very big stir. This tiny creature inhabited increasingly large tanks. One or two would spring a leak, more emergencies for Chris! After 15 years the fish’ life was cut short with illness. During those years Chris researched and became an expert on goldfish and the household learnt more about fluid dynamics, the mathematics of shoal formation, and fish behaviour, identifying that ours was female! An early riser in later years, Chris identified the various birds in the garden from listening to birdsong, even recognising individual blackbirds. Refusing to have a favourite animal Chris admired the intelligent car driving rats and the manipulative crows using traffic lights to break open and collect nuts.

At work, there were time pressures for getting things published, however Chris was very painstaking in his methods. Sometimes there were mathematical recipes or publications from other scientists which he was to use, however he tested and retested their results and usually ended with returning to the start of his project working everything out from scratch. In his later years at work, all the eminent dignitaries would be assigned to him. He was able to defend solid research confidently and calmly. Although through this role he represented his department and relished the challenges presented, he never lost his disregard for convention. Had he been asked to choose between lemon or milk in his tea by one of these dignitaries he would have cared less for that tradition, and like Richard Feynman, may have absent-mindedly asked for both!

Out and about Chris was never too grand to pick up others’ litter and on occasion would thrust it back into the offender’s hand. Chris enjoyed being controversial and would joke about his own Irish Catholic and German background in any group! His emotions were very split on religion.

During Chris’ busy life he loved to read and surrounded himself with books. Ancient epic poems, sagas and histories from different eras, numerous books on art, and science, covering a range of fields. His parents in law were delighted that Chris shared their passion for books, with a penguin classics series rivalling their own. Curious and beautiful covers, we see all Chris’ books as an extension of him. In the garden he built a solid little path from various bricks and logs from storm-damaged branches, making the garden accessible. It is a great blessing and a comfort to contemplate. Happy memories flood back and bring us closer to him.

## Thoughts, by Philippa

Dad’s life was often afflicted with illness and hardship but he didn’t dwell on his suffering. He was admirable in his stoicism and had huge empathy for others who were unwell.

Dad was kind and gentle in nature and had a huge belief in the potential of others, he assumed intellect equal to his own of anyone he spoke to. He was a patient and passionate teacher and had time for everyone, from teaching PhD physics, to teaching maths and chess to friends in the local pub, to possibly the most praiseworthy, teaching advanced algebra to a yawning and fidgeting teenage daughter. Many of his later projects included painstakingly writing and recording tutorials to enable others to learn and replicate his methods.

As well as his affinity for the cosmos and physical and theoretical worlds, dad had many interests spanning punk rock, classical literature, philosophy, theology, art, politics and history. He had a fantastically good memory when it came to global historical events and could delve into and analyse the historic and geopolitical context in a way which brought them to life. Many will remember my Dad’s wicked, dark and absurdist sense of humour. He was sharp in wit, enjoyed obscure references to film and literature and had many running in-jokes with close friends and family.

I owe much of my taste in music to my dad’s genre spanning catalogue and can credit him for introducing me to Herodotus Histories, Icelandic Sagas, the Dadaist and Surrealist art movements and much more. Some of my fondest memories of dad are him reading to me as a child, something he did devotedly from Beatrix Potter, C.S. Lewis, Tolkien to later, Mark Twain and the adventures of Tom Sawyer, always with voices and accents to bring the stories to life.

Early memories of observing the night sky with binoculars, constructing home made pinhole eclipse projectors and listening to and identifying birdsong with dad sparked my interest in science and the natural world. Some of his abstract paintings inspired my own art and hang in my home today. My dad meant the world to me and shaped me enormously, he was an inspiration, a limitless source of fascinating conversation and a wonderful support. I love him dearly and will miss him very much indeed.

## Eulogy by John Devaney

Chris was a very special friend and a tremendous inspiration to me ever since my early teenage years. Socially, we both tended to live outside the norm, characterized by a daredevil maverick streak which served to hide our intrinsic shyness, but together we learned to accept and celebrate our uniqueness. We both shared a wacky sense of the absurd as well as an adventurous fun-loving spirit. We saw the world as a wonderland waiting to be explored and we had an insatiable thirst to learn about this curious universe we were thrust into. For me, this initially manifested itself through a keen interest in amateur astronomy. Chris, naturally, latched onto this boyhood hobby and, in later years, it eventually led to him establishing his own astronomy club at his university campus. More importantly, however, Chris soon developed a profoundly deep and abiding fascination with mathematics, physics, and philosophy and this stayed with him throughout his life. 
   
   We first befriended each other during our formative years at the Hugh Faringdon Secondary School where we instantly bonded over our mutual love of music and space-age TV shows. The popular music during this period was Glam Rock and we both became utterly mesmerized by Bowie and Bolan; we would spend hours listening and trying to decipher their strange surreal lyricism. When not losing ourselves in music, we would often lose ourselves on long adventurous rambles across the floodplains of the River Kennet. We could equally lose ourselves in nature just as much as we could embrace pop futurism. We discovered that there were no limits to the learning process once you escape the narrow confines of school.  
   
   Music was important to both of us and helped to instill a strong sense of personal non-conformist identity. Chris became my gig buddy throughout the second half of the seventies. We regularly attended Reading’s very own punk club, based in a former underground mortuary, called ‘Bones’. Some of the punk bands we saw together included The Damned, Wasted Youth, The Ruts, 999, Nick Cave & The Birthday Party, The Fall, Subway Sect, etc. Chris once freaked-out my parents one night when he came to the door wearing his ‘Bela Lugosi’s Dead’ black overcoat with a painted face; inspired by Bauhaus. Our first punk gig was at the Bracknell Arts Centre Cellar Bar where The Lazers were playing; we did a frantic stranglehold dance to a punky version of “Suffragette City”, which had most of the audience edging away from us, and our lives were never quite the same afterwards!
  
  We would take a train ride to London to visit the ICA and, one memorable night, we witnessed The Angel of Death in the form of Nico performing with The Sisters of Mercy. We once came across an eccentric old Londoner in a wheelchair, called Mr. Gardiner, and we spent most of the day wheeling him around the city which included a ‘royal tour’ of The Mall. We used to go to all-night cinema shows at the London Scala which was the only place you could get to see some of the more outrageous films of the day including those starring Divine. The two greatest ‘golden tickets’ I ever acquired for him were to see Bowie, as The Thin White Duke in 1976, and also to see his beloved Kraftwerk. Other musical highlights in his life were witnessing Robert Calvert and Hawkwind, during the Atomhenge Tour, and joining the anarchic throng at Crass gigs which were held in, of all places, the local town hall. These were exuberantly cathartic and transformative times which will, sadly, never return. And Chris was very much a part of it.
    
   Chris was always fascinated by the gothic style in music, art, and literature. He was also heavily influenced by Dali and the surrealists. As well as sharing his insights into the world of art, Chris also introduced me to the fantasy writers Russell Hoban and Clarke Ashton Smith whose word-sorcery ignited both our imaginations. We would often experiment with Dadaist poetry, sharing words randomly assembled to create weird juxtapositions, which were a key to unlocking the subliminal workings of our collective unconscious. At the most fundamental level, Chris was not afraid to experiment and theorize on the true nature of the world and our perceptions of it. This quality of intensely focused inquiry became invaluable during his research years at Reading University and later during his own groundbreaking computer projects.
    
   Essentially, Chris had an extremely gifted intellect and was a multi-faceted and hugely talented individual. He did, indeed, ‘play many parts’ during his life: Painter, Poet, Philosopher, Punk Rocker, Teacher, Doctor of Physics, and a distinguished Mathematician. He was also a devoted and caring father to his daughter, Philippa, who strangely inherited some of her dad’s gothic tendencies as a teenager! He was immensely proud of what she had achieved with her life. He was a beloved husband to Beatrice who worked so hard to provide the stability he needed during his protracted illness and they somehow found the strength to support each other emotionally through the toughest of times. Despite his own worsening physical disability, he retained the capacity to smile through his pain and our final meetings together were still imbued with that warm familiar kinship cultivated from a lifetime of friendship.
    
   Words cannot adequately express how much I loved and admired Chris as a friend. He leaves me with a wealth of glorious and happy memories to treasure. I feel truly blessed to have known him. We may have trod very different academic paths, and we were sometimes at odds with each other when it came to the answer to ‘life, the universe, and everything’, but we were as one in our respect and affection for one another. Above all, we both shared an unflinching fiery determination to succeed in our chosen endeavours. A few weeks prior to his death, while struggling with his own mortality, he made the big breakthrough he was always working towards. Chris had finally succeeded in making his comprehensive digital research material readily accessible to the wider academic world. A fitting legacy for a brilliant, brave, and lovably eccentric man.
    
   Chris would have wanted me to finish on a lyrical note. Chris was like a shooting star in a darkening sky. Now he is a glistening tear in my transcendent eye. God bless you Chris.

## Thoughts, by Bob

As for me, I couldn't have had a better brother who carried himself through all his problems with great dignity. We had many conversations on a Sunday about science, films, politics, the Royal Family etc. We didn't always agree but over the many years we never argued. I wish him well wherever he's gone, and look forward to many debates in the future.

## Thoughts, by Philippa Campbell

(Written on an Einstein birthday card to Beatrice and Philippa with the message "have a relatively happy birthday")

Chris would have appreciated it... you shared a special subtle humour and we remember his voice, so relaxes and light. We remember all the happy times when you both came to Costerton, and the times we stayed with you at number 42. Only once did Chris opt out of anything and we still laugh about it; seeing 'gone with the wind' again in Lothian road, Chris said he "couldn't handle it" with a little shudder! 

I think how very sympathetic he was concerning others' physical problems, trivial compared with his own, which he lived with most of his life. He never seemed to complain. We think of easier days when he was well enough to join us on an expedition by car in the deepest Berkshire countryside. We owe those experiences to you both, visiting those Thamesside houses like Downton Abbey. Lots of good photos of Sunny occasions, with Chris wearing his signature summer hats.

He had a wonderful appreciation of birds. Whenever our bird clock sings out, I will enjoy it with Chris.

Chris Godsalve was the most amazing and wonderful friend. He was instrumental in encouraging me to continue with studies in maths and physics, generally over a few beers. Without that I I’d never have continued but simply because of him I went on to PhD so I owe much of the best things in my life to him. I saw you in Edinburgh when you were very little Philippa, probably too early for you to remember. It was so funny as your dad was incredibly flexible and could imitate you biting your toenails!

In school I used to demonstrate respiration to the kids. Bicycle pump and tube used to inflate sheep’s lungs. Once, things went a bit wrong. On removing the tube to allow deflation the vocal cords were activated. MMMeeehhh! A few kids looked wobbly and took off. The rest were shouting ‘Again Again!’’ Had a few beers with Chris that night. He loved it and wished he was there.

Chris was always someone I have looked up too and later in life when I went to my first international conference in Utah he again had pioneered the route. Utah is a ‘dry’ state. That didn’t stop Chris! He had already been on the ground and sussed everything out. He found ‘The Dead Goat Saloon in Salt Lake City’. Check that out online. 

‘It was tucked away in the basement of a building at the back of Arrow Press Square in the heart of downtown Salt Lake City — and that only stoked its popularity. You practically needed a map to find The Dead Goat Saloon down a dark alleyway. It was as if only cool people would know about the place.16 Feb 2016.’ 

It’s gone now but Chris found it working probably only by sense of smell.  Years after his trip when myself and Joe Crayston arrived there in 1996 I asked many of the indigenous Mormons where it was. We were met with frowns rather than the traditional bright smiles and they walked on by. Joe didn’t believe me over the legend but we pursued and finally found it! Chris didn’t say how completely wild the place was. They had genuine cowboys and girls with guns in holsters line dancing getting very drunk. I can imagine Chris joining in.   
We are all going to miss my mad mentor Chris. One of the most amazing, intelligent and fun of people to ever walk the Earth.

## Thoughts by Palli

I knew Chris through my relationship with Philippa. Meeting the parents of a loved-one for the first time can be a daunting experience, but Chris and Beatrice immediately put me at ease. I was welcomed with open arms and they showed me great kindness from the very beginning. Being from Iceland, I was taken aback by Chris’ knowledge of the Icelandic sagas, and his profound interest in the literature of my country and me as an individual cemented an enduring friendship. 

Chris and Beatrice, an unsung comedy double act with compassion and empathy to match their gentle humour. One memory that comes to mind took place at the home of Chris’ mum Liese. Beatrice was attempting to explain the concept of Lent, whereupon Chris stood shaking his head in bewilderment with perfect comedic timing. We always giggled our way through Sunday dinners and yet Chris instinctively knew when I was in need of a sympathetic ear, being geographically apart from my own family. My abiding memory from those family gatherings is of a house filled with laughter.

His humility belied an intellectual prowess and he never lost his youthful curiosity. Never one to complain, Chris bore numerous illnesses stoically. A true survivor until sadly an unexpected adversary took him from us before his time. My deepest condolences to the family.

## Preparing to say goodbye -

 We are devastated at the loss of a great man who means to much to us. There’s no words for the loss and sometimes the grief is unbearable, but there are also lot of added layers with necessary COVID-19 restrictions, which are prohibitive to the grieving process, and go against every human instinct to go, to be together, to embrace, to share stories in the pub.

There must be so many families going through this and it’s heart wrenching. The deaths from C19 in the UK are vastly under-reported; at the time of writing there were 953 new C19 related deaths today, however only those people who have been tested and died in NHS hospitals are included in this grim tally, my dad is not. My thoughts are with everyone whose lives have been altered by this horrible virus, which is proving to expose huge inequalities.

We are however trying to take comfort that dad was at home; he spent so much time in hospital throughout his life and hated being at the mercy of others. It has also been a huge comfort and an emotional journey reminiscing about dad, writing about his life, looking at his books, listening to music, digging out and laughing at old photos and hearing tributes and memories from his friends and family, albeit virtually

His memory must be celebrated, and it's been such a pleasure to read contributions from old friends much in the spirit of sharing stories over a pint. Though currently isolated, myself and my mum Beatrice have been overwhelmed with love and kindness from family and friends, sharing their kind wishes, support and memories of dad. 

‘Meanwhile, back at the ranch..’ as dad would say, we have finished the funeral preparations which has been no small feat. My mum and I have felt under immense pressure to do justice to such a brilliant person who was a deep thinker and had a vast array of interests, as well as to adequately convey what he meant to us.

We have tried to do this as best we could within the limited time window and have had to trim down our content rather ruthlessly, however the long form version of the eulogy is found above, as well as the remarkable eulogy written by lifelong friend John Devaney which makes for essential reading. Music choices have been difficult too, but we laughed a lot thinking up some absurd and completely inappropriate choices in keeping with dad’s sense of humour! One of these made the cut and we hope dad would have been amused at an alternative Lord’s Prayer by Siouxsie and the Banshees.

The funeral will be held at 15.15 on Tuesday 14th April.

This will be a small gathering restricted to family only due to C19 restrictions, however the webcast can be accessed using the link below.

Love and warmth,

## The Blue Blazer - 11th April 2020

I was in the Blue Blazer waiting for Chris and John. There are two doors into that pub. It’s small but on a corner. Your mum knows it. At the same instant they entered through each door. Nothing hugely unusual as they used to approach from opposite directions but this time both were wearing brand new plaster casts over their right arms. The 3 of us saw each other immediately and burst out laughing. Way before mobile phones no one knew Chris had had an accident with a chain fence and John had similarly fractured his wrist playing basketball the night before. We discovered that the old huge plaster casts were perfectly fine support for pints of beer. Albeit a bit messy.
