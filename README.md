This is a tribute page, intended to celebrate and document the life of Dr Christopher Godsalve, and to bring together some of his pages and publications. He will be remembered as a loving husband to Beatrice, father to Philippa, and as a physicist who was devoted to his work. 

Chris’ fields of research included heat conduction, carrier diffusion, nonlinear optics, radiative transfer, spectroscopy, satellite orbits, and remote sensing. In later life Chris suffered from chronic illness, but continued with many self-directed projects in maths, physics and computing.

## Biography

#### Early life

Chris was born on 4th August 1959 in Kingston upon Hull. His parents were Thomas and Lieselotte Godsalve (later Cripps), who adopted him in the early 1960’s. Chris knew nothing of his Irish birth parents other than their names - Kavanagh and McRory.

Chris’ father Tom had previously been a staff sergeant in the Royal Berkshire regiment of the British Army, who’s long army career saw him travel across India, Burma, Cyprus and Germany. He later transferred to a role as head chef in the catering corps in the Arborfield camp. Here Chris spent his early years.

Tom left the army abruptly for a low paid job, and the family moved to a tiny caravan. Life in the caravan was hard, they had very little money and the pipes often froze in cold weather preventing access to running water.

#### School years

Things were soon on the up after Tom became a security guard and Lisa started work in a factory. Eventually they were able to afford a house in Southcote, Reading, where Chris went to school. Holidays included trips to stay with Lisa’s family in the Rhineland, Germany where Chris formed a close bond and admiration for his Grandpa ‘Opa Fritz’ who was a communist, a snappy dresser and appreciated Chris’ intelligence and sensitive nature. Chris attended Blessed Hugh Farringdon school, here he met lifelong friend John Devaney. They shared a love of music.

There were some formative events which shaped Chris’ huge sense of social justice and political awareness. Possibly the most powerful of these were his father Tom suffering a debilitating stroke in 1971 but then being declared ‘fit for work’ and social security benefits stopped. Chris became very aware of what he saw as the media demonisation of people accessing support from the government. Chris grew up around men who had been hardened by war and had enormous respect for them but considered himself a pacifist. His mother Lisa amusedly remembered switching on the TV one evening and spotting Chris in a huge crowd on a peace protest in London. She had just started to worry as he hadn’t come home for tea and hadn’t given an inkling where he was going.

Chris’ father Tom sadly died very suddenly of liver cancer in 1977, having been diagnosed just 4 weeks earlier. Chris was 18 and his father’s death impacted him greatly. This was a dark time; Chris became unwell with schizoaffective disorder and spent some time in Fairmile psychiatric hospital. Lisa married Victor Cripps in 1979 after meeting him through the British Legion and acting as a translator with the German branch. Vic was instrumental in supporting Chris in his recovery and encouraging him to pursue his studies in maths and physics.

#### University and academic life

Chris went off to university at Heriot-Watt in Edinburgh to study physics. He studied to PhD level over a period of 7 years. Chris worked late into the night on his PhD research project on the university grounds and remembered picking his way through pitch black corridors long after the lights in the building had been switched off. He and his peers were conceptualising and researching a proposed optical computer which was never built, but they thought it could possibly have similar potential to conceptualised quantum computers today.

Throughout his studies Chris worked hard to support himself financially and had various jobs as a labourer, a warehouse operative and making tea in a bank to name a few. It wasn’t all work and no play; Chris shared an Edinburgh tenement flat with great friends. They went drinking, recorded music together and went to support gigs of some iconic musicians. After gaining his PhD Chris stayed on at Heriot-Watt for a further 2 years working in research in the physics department.

#### Marriage and professional life

In the late 1980’s Chris was volunteering his time at the local council to help people with maths. He struck up a romantic relationship with a student of his, Beatrice. They fell in love, married in 1990 and had daughter Philippa in 1991. They lived happily in Edinburgh until 1992 then moved to Reading when Chris was offered a job a Reading University as a scientist in the Environmental Systems Science Centre (ESSC) now known as University of Reading Meteorology.

Devoted to his work at the ESSC, Chris researched weather systems, cloud physics, atmospheric radiation, remote sensing and much more. He raised money and won grants for his research in the department. Unfortunately, towards the end of his professional life, Chris’ work was mired by Ulcerative Colitis. He struggled on with terrible symptoms but was eventually made redundant in 2001 and was too unwell to work again. His disease never went into remission despite large doses of steroids and immunomodulating drugs.

#### Later years

At home, he looked after daughter Philippa, cooked, gave maths and art lessons, masterminded and assisted with many creative projects, and took her to Irish Dancing classes.

Chris’ illness made daily life difficult, despite this he continued to apply his commendable work ethic to develop numerous projects including publishing a ‘maths school’, computer programming including graphics software, and further research into environmental physics. He kept his foot in the academic world writing papers and was in touch with Nobel prize winning scientists about his work.

In 2012 Chris was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after feeling short of breath for some time. He had lost a significant amount of lung function. The prognosis was not good, but with the help of home oxygen Chris was able to retain independence and continue his work. Chris had a recent breakthrough with a computer graphics project and had more he wanted to achieve.

Chris sadly passed away on 29th March 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic after a short battle with the disease. He will be missed terribly by family and friends.

## Thoughts by daughter, Philippa

Dad’s life was often afflicted with illness and hardship, but he always remained incredibly positive and didn’t dwell on his suffering. He was admirable in his stoicism and had huge empathy for others who were unwell.

Dad was kind and gentle in nature and had a huge belief in the potential of others, he assumed intellect equal to his own of anyone he spoke to. He was a patient and passionate teacher and had time for everyone, from teaching PhD physics, to teaching maths and chess to friends in the local pub, to possibly the most praiseworthy, teaching advanced algebra to a yawning and fidgeting teenage daughter. Many of his later projects included painstakingly writing and recording tutorials to enable others to replicate his methods.

As well as his affinity for the cosmos and physical and theoretical worlds, dad had many interests spanning punk rock, classical literature, philosophy, theology, art, politics and history. He had a fantastically good memory when it came to global historical events and could delve into and analyse the historic and geopolitical context in a way which brought them to life. Many will remember my Dad’s wicked, dark and absurdist sense of humour. He was sharp in wit, enjoyed obscure references to film and literature and had many running in-jokes with close friends and family.

I owe much of my taste in music to my dad’s genre spanning catalogue and can credit him for introducing me to Herodotus Histories, Icelandic Sagas, the Dadaist and Surrealist art movements and much more. Some of my fondest memories of dad are him reading to me as a child, something he did devotedly from Beatrix Potter, C.S. Lewis, Tolkien to later, Mark Twain and the adventures of Tom Sawyer, always with voices and accents to bring the stories to life.

Early memories of observing the night sky with binoculars, constructing home made pinhole eclipse projectors and listening to and identifying birdsong with dad sparked my interest in science and the natural world. Some of his abstract paintings inspired my own art and hang in my home today. My dad meant the world to me and shaped me enormously, he was an inspiration, a limitless source of fascinating conversation and a wonderful support. I love him dearly and will miss him very much indeed.
